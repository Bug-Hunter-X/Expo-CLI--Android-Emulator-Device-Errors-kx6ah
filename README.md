# Expo CLI: Android Emulator/Device Errors

This repository demonstrates common errors and their solutions when working with the Expo CLI and Android emulators or devices.  These issues often manifest without a single, clear error message, making debugging challenging.  This repo provides examples and solutions to help you resolve these common problems. 

## Common Issues

* **Emulator not starting or connecting:** This is a frequent problem with various root causes, including incorrect emulator settings, insufficient resources, and conflicts with other applications.
* **Build failures:** Expo's Android build process can fail due to missing dependencies, incorrect configurations, or problems with the Android SDK.
* **Device not recognized:**  Sometimes the device may not be properly recognized by Expo CLI, preventing deployment.
* **Slow or unresponsive emulator:** Poor emulator performance can hinder development. 
* **Missing dependencies:** Build process can fail because of missing or outdated native modules.

## Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Verify Android SDK Installation and Setup:** Ensure the Android SDK is properly installed and configured. Check the environment variables (`ANDROID_HOME`, `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`) and ensure the platform tools and build-tools are up-to-date. 
2. **Check Emulator Settings:** Verify that your emulator is configured correctly, with sufficient RAM and storage allocated. Restart the emulator or try creating a new virtual device.
3. **Examine Expo CLI logs:** Carefully examine the detailed output of the Expo CLI commands. This frequently contains clues about the error.
4. **Clean and rebuild:** Clean the project's build cache and try building the project again. `expo prebuild`, followed by `expo run:android`.
5. **Check Dependencies:** Ensure you're not missing dependencies and that existing dependencies are compatible.
6. **Update SDKs and dependencies:** Keeping Expo CLI, the Android SDK, and the project's dependencies up-to-date is vital for stability.
7. **Check Network Connectivity:**  Ensure good network access if the issues involve downloading or updating components.
